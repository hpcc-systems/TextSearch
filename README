==========

TextSearch ECL code
Initial version of attributes from XCR_DocSearch.  Attributes need to be
modified to remove dependencies upon the MNCR code base.

Attributes structured as:
Common:  Layouts, types, and other common definitions.
Inverted: Attributes that define the inversion and related.
Regression: Attributes that define regression tests.
Resolved: Attributes that define the answer set.
